This is the code repository for [R Bioinformatics Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/business-other/r-bioinformatics-cookbook), published by Packt.

**Use R and Bioconductor to perform RNAseq, genomics, data visualization, and bioinformatic analysis**

## What is this book about?
In  R Bioinformatics Cookbook, you encounter common and not-so-common challenges in the bioinformatics domain and solve them using real-world examples. The book guides you through varied bioinformatics analysis, from raw data to clean results. It shows you how to import, explore and evaluate your data and how to report it.	

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Employ Bioconductor to determine differential expressions in RNAseq data
* Run SAMtools and develop pipelines to find single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Indels
* Use ggplot to create and annotate a range of visualizations
* Query external databases with Ensembl to find functional genomics information
* Execute large-scale multiple sequence alignment with DECIPHER to perform comparative genomics
* Use d3.js and Plotly to create dynamic and interactive web graphics
* Use k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines and random forests to find groups and classify data

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager"))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install() 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for data scientists, bioinformatics analysts, researchers, and R developers who want to address intermediate-to-advanced biological and bioinformatics problems using a recipe-based approach. Working knowledge of the R programming language and some basic understanding of bioinformatics are mandatory.

 
With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
### Software and Hardware List
