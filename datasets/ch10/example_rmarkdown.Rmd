We can include text and create code blocks, the code gets executed and the result passed in

```{r}
x <- iris$Sepal.Width
y <- iris$Sepal.Length

lm(y ~ x, data = iris)
```

## We can format text using Markdown

We can create many text formats including *italics* and **bold**,

We can make lists

1. First item
2. Second item


The whole document acts as a single R session - so variables created in earlier blocks can still be used later.

Plots are presented within the document. Options for blocks can be set in the header

```{r, fig.width=12 }
plot(x, y)
```
